# 🔒 SecureForm

**SecureForm** is a toolkit that scans and hardens web forms against common vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and clickjacking. It provides suggestions and automatically injects security headers and token protections during development, ensuring that web forms are secure by design.

SecureForm simplifies the process of securing web forms, helping developers focus on functionality while ensuring that security best practices are followed automatically.

## 📌 Features

- 🛡️ **Vulnerability Scanning**:
  - Scans web forms for common security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, clickjacking)
  - Detects unsafe HTML elements, JavaScript, and form handling practices
  - Provides detailed vulnerability reports with recommendations for fixes

- 🔑 **Automatic Security Enhancements**:
  - Automatically injects security headers such as **Content-Security-Policy** and **X-Frame-Options**
  - Generates and embeds **CSRF tokens** in forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks
  - Adds **XSS protection** by sanitizing form input and ensuring proper encoding

- 🛠️ **Form Security Suggestions**:
  - Offers step-by-step suggestions for improving form security
  - Recommends safer input validation methods and proper use of HTTP headers
  - Integrates with existing form-handling codebases to suggest the best security practices

- 🔄 **Continuous Security Integration**:
  - Can be integrated into your development pipeline (e.g., CI/CD) to continuously monitor form security
  - Alerts developers about new vulnerabilities as they emerge
  - Supports both manual form creation and form builder platforms

- 📈 **Security Reports**:
  - Generates easy-to-read security audit reports with actionable insights
  - Reports include a breakdown of detected vulnerabilities, risks, and steps to mitigate
  - Allows developers to track security improvements over time

- 🔐 **User Privacy & Data Protection**:
  - Implements security measures that ensure user data is not leaked or exposed
  - Supports end-to-end encryption for sensitive form submissions
  - Complies with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (for form handling and security header injection)
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/Django for form protection logic)
- **Security Libraries**: Helmet.js (for HTTP headers), DOMPurify (for XSS sanitization)
- **Token Management**: JWT, CSRF tokens (for form protection)
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
